dev qa stage prod
levels of testing:

unittesting-

public int sum(int a, int b){
return a+b;
}

public void sumTest(){
 sum(4,5);//9
 sum(-4,-5);//-14
 sum('a','b');
 sum(0,0)
 sum(40.56, 30.56)
}

TDD - test driven development
Calculator - basic coding
unit test cases- 15 test cases - 7 pass 8 failed
make changes to the code - 12 passed - 3 failed
18testcases
testcases/scripts are driving the developement - thats reason they call TestDrivenDevelopment
main adv- early stages most of defects are identified and fixed

integration testing

system testing

user acceptance testing

SystemIntegrationTesting:

Types of testing:

SmokeTesting - priority test cases as per requirement , subset of functional testcases

Functionality Testing

Usability Testing - look and feel

color 
size
font specifications
layouts
links- broken links-
3 click rule
responsive design- adjusting to the given screen size without losing content of application
ajax - loads data parallely but not synchronously
infinite scrolling
paginations
typos
resolutions

Performance Testing - 
Load Testing -simultaneous requests from multiple users
VolumeTesting - with huge volumes of data
StressTesting- finding breaking point of the application- 

500 users -- 
1000 users - breaking point

SecurityTesting -
Authentication- uname, pwd, touchBased-finger prints, securityQuestions, captcha images, retinascanning, smartCards, otp,SingleSignOn
Authorization- roles and permissions- admin role, userrole, prime user, normal user, 
Vulnarabilties:
CrossSiteScripting- trying to hack the application/system using malicious code/scripts
SQL Injection-
DDOS

Refer Owasp for more details on security testing

Localization and internationalisation

timezone, timings

Accesibilty:/ada compliant
text to speech conversions
voice recognition
soft buttons
html - aria attributes
alt texts


Configuration and compatibility:

multiple browsers
multiple OS

RegressionTesting - making sure all the properly working functionalities are not broken bcz of defect fix or bcz of new enhancements.
Retesting- test specific raised defect 

InstallationTesting
**************************

uat
alpha testing -  within company releae product and internal employers of company test it while using it.
beta testing --   release product  to end users and users test it while using it.get their feedback or complaints and work on it.


prod/live:
prod validation testing 

*********************************
Static Testing - requirements, documents, walkthroughs, inspections
Dynamic Testing:

BlackBoxTesting - testing application without knowing the internal details (code, design)

WhiteBoxTesting - testing application by knowing the internal details (code, design)

given num is div by 3 and 5


public String isDiv(int input){


if(input%3==0 && input%5==0){
return "div by both 3 and 5";
}
else if(input%3==0){
return "div by both 3";
}

else if ( input%5==0){
return "div by both 5";
}

else{
return "not div by any 3 or 5";
}
}
