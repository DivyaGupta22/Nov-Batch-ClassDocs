Disadv:

TimeConsuming
Human Error
More resources
Cost Ineffective
Redundant taks again and again


Automation :

Save Time and Resources


verify all links are working properly in given page


When we cannot go for automation:


start new automation fw from scratch with short dead lines is not possible

How to do it


UnitTesting - 
Entry Criteria - individual modules are done 60%
ExitCriteria- all unit test cases are successful

SmokeTesting-
Entry Criteria - dev is done and until testing is done
ExitCriteria- priortiy testcases are working fine

Functionality- 
Entry Criteria
ExitCriteria- 70% testcases are sucees and prioroity defects are fixed.

Usability-

can one server processs billions of reqs?


multiple servers, clustering , caching, sessions, cookies


google- client req on browser
firewall- to prevent malicious attacks
loadbalancer- balances load by some algorithms - round robin, random order.....

webserver - static http requests- html pages, images....
apache http, microsoft IIS
application server - dynamic data retrival
tomcat, jboss, weblogic, ibm -websphere, 
Db server- db request

to maintain performance:
effective cpu, memory and resource utilistion:


efficient coding without memory leaks, without time taking alogorithms
db - queries should be efficient, indexes, db con pools, caching
browser - caching, sessions, cookies

sit env - replica of prod env
