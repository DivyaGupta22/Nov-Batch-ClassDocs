RestAPI:

crud operations:

get - retrieval - say u pass order id and get order details
get wil not have request body
post - creation of resource-  give order detials - order gets created with new id
post will have request body
put - updating the resource - to update existing order id details 
delete - delete the resource - delete the order with order id 

what to test:
statuscode
contetnt type, length - headers
actual response 

Different AUthentication types:
Auth - to secure the api's
Basic - user eneters uname and pwd , token id is generated which is to be persisted for further requests eg: talentscreen
OAuth - key and access tokens are generated as per api's - eg:twitter apis
public api's - api key - eg:google


Load Testing - performance of the api
tps - threads per second
bps - bytes per second

Threads- no fo concurrent/parallel user requests

Strategy-  simple, burst, variance

TEstDelay -Time in ms b/n each batch of requests
Random - random factor for test load 
eg: test delay -400, rf =0.5
delay is distributd  b/n 400*0.5 - 
so delay  will be 200-400



o/p:

min- shoertest time step has taken to execute(ms)
max- longest time step has taken to execute(ms)
avg- avg time step has taken to execute(ms)
cnt - no of time sstep has been executed
err- assertion Errors

Security Testing - SoapUI tool supports in built




SoapMock service: used when you are not able to user actual service

https://www.soapui.org/soap-mocking/service-mocking-overview.html
Data Driven Testing- running same test step with different set of data
SoapUIPRo- DataSource and DataSourceLoop step for data driven testing
