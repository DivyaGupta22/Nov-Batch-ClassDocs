**********************************
How Qa test webservices?
1. Go through the specifications(docs) to understand functionality of webservice.
2. Analyse input parameters to be passed and what response you are expecting.
3.  Functionalty Testing - You will test actual response  by adding assertions.
What kind of assertions:
status code
header information - content type, content length
actual elements
actual data

Soap websrvices:

Soap is a protocol. It follows WSDL standards.
WSDL- webservice definition language.
